#What is it?

Cook cars and turn them into popcorn. 


Inspired by the work of 'MoMadenU'. 

During one of his training videos for his Native WorkBench he was testing some code and was having fun with opening car doors and making them fly. 

It reminded me of popcorn a bit, and wanted to completed the look as best I could. I find the mod fun and I hope you do too ;-)
